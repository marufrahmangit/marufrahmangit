I define and deliver high-impact solutions by connecting business goals, user workflows, and engineering realities. With hands-on technical experience and cross-functional leadership, I guide teams through ambiguity to ship reliable, scalable, and user-centered outcomes.

Over the past 9+ years, I’ve progressed from software engineer to senior system analyst and product leader, delivering solutions that balance user needs, business priorities, and technical feasibility. I partner with cross-functional teams to define problems, scope features, and ensure reliable execution in complex environments.
